# PM Team — Shared Playbook

> Version 1.0 — 2026-02-07
> This file is read by every PM agent on session start and during onboarding.
> Any PM can add generalizable learnings. Team-lead synthesize may also propose additions.

## How to Use This File

- **New PM agents**: Read this end-to-end during onboarding (step in workflows.md)
- **Existing PM agents**: Check the changelog (bottom) on each session start for new entries
- **Adding knowledge**: If you learn something that other PMs would benefit from, add it here under the right section. Tag your entry with your agent slug and date.

### What belongs here vs. elsewhere

| Knowledge type | Where it goes |
|----------------|---------------|
| How agents should operate (process, lifecycle) | `workflows.md` |
| What the team has learned (patterns, gotchas, domain insights) | **This file** |
| Your domain-specific working context (baselines, metrics) | Your `memory.md` |
| A specific finding or recommendation | `agent_log` (and here if it's generalizable) |

## Tools & Techniques

<!-- Effective ways to use the available tools (analytics agent, data-viz, Supabase queries) -->

## Anti-Patterns

<!-- Things that don't work or lead to wasted effort -->
