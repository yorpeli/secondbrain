# Q-Plan PM — Memory

## Active Quarters

| Quarter | Status | Initiatives Tracked | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Q1-2026 | Active | KYC Vendor Optimization | First quarter tracked. 5 HL items, 14 deliverables. |
| Q3-2026 | Active | Whole CLM org | Plan `Q3-2026`; 6 strategic threads as plan_items. Knowledge home: `quarter-planning` pillar → `q3-2026-planning` child. Line-item (deliverable) capture pending. |

## Quarter Planning pillar (knowledge home)

Quarterly planning now has a canonical knowledge home in the `initiatives` table:
- **Pillar `quarter-planning`** (kind=`pillar`) — the planning **method** + **metrics glossary** (BRR, FFT, CVR, TICP, MW/capacity). Its memory doc is the operating manual.
- **Per-quarter children** (kind=`initiative`, parent_id → pillar) — e.g. `q3-2026-planning`. Each child's memory doc holds that quarter's threads, postures, decisions, owners, risks, and links to its `quarterly_plans` row.

**This agent maintains both** the pillar memory (method + metrics) and each quarter child's memory, alongside the structured `quarterly_plans` / `_items` / `_deliverables` tables. Read the child memory before working a quarter: `searchByType(query, ['initiative_memory'])` or the memory doc directly. Structured plan = machine-readable; memory docs = narrative knowledge. No duplication.

## Initiative Planning Patterns

### KYC Vendor Optimization (Q1-2026)
- HL deck structure: 1-slide table with Initiative / Description / Q1 Impact / Q2 Impact columns
- Execution deck structure: multi-slide tables with Theme / Feature / Timing / Impact columns
- 5 HL items map to 14 deliverables across themes: Expansion, Orchestration, Optimization, RT Experience, Data Transparency
- "Enable Online Experience" has the most deliverables (7) — concentration risk
- Impact measured in "% CLM CVR" — this is the standard metric for vendor optimization

## Deck Parsing Conventions

- HL decks: look for tables with "Initiative" or "Feature" in header row
- Execution decks: look for tables with "Theme" / "Feature" / "Timing" / "Impact" columns
- Impact columns may be split (Q1/Q2) or combined
- Timing is free-text (e.g., "Mid January", "End of March") — not standardized dates
- Some execution decks have multiple roadmap tables across slides (slides 7-8 in KYC Documents)
- Vendor testing timelines (TP/TN) appear in separate tables — not always mappable to HL items

## Conventions

### Pending Outreach lifecycle
When the agent sends a structured update request to initiative owners:
1. Store the outreach in `## Pending Outreach` with deliverable ID mapping and processing instructions
2. When the user shares the response, parse it, apply DB updates, update initiative memory
3. **After processing, delete the outreach entry from this file** to keep memory clean
4. If no response after 2 weeks, flag it in the next `status` run as "outreach unanswered — consider follow-up"

## Intel Sources (multi-source lookup)

When looking for deliverable status updates, the agent checks **all sources**, not just PPP:
1. **PPP sections** — weekly swimlane reports (primary signal)
2. **Meetings** — discussion_notes from 1:1s, team meetings, project meetings (last 30 days)
3. **Meeting action items** — open items related to deliverables
4. **Initiative memories** — living docs with accumulated context
5. **Agent log** — findings/recommendations from other agents

When deliverables are 14+ days overdue with no status change, or have no recent mentions across any source, the agent recommends outreach to initiative owners for a structured update.

## Open Questions

1. How should PPP swimlane updates map to deliverable status changes? Manual for now.
2. Should the agent auto-detect when a deliverable timing has passed and flag it? Yes — status command does this.
3. What's the threshold for "overdue" — strict target_date or some buffer? Currently strict. Stale data threshold: 14 days past due.
