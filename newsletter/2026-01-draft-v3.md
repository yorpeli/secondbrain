# CLM Newsletter – January 2026

Hi All,

In January, the UK became our first country at 100% CLM rollout, we launched e-Collection across 7 countries, and shipped real-time document quality feedback.

Corrections and additions welcome — reach out directly.

## Status of CLM

The UK reached 100% CLM rollout in January with a 47% approval rate — the highest of any hub country and our first full-country deployment. Early evidence for the localization-first approach: local e-verification vendors, country-specific document handling, and tailored flows produced a 47% approval rate versus 19–21% overall.

Overall approval rates remained in the 19–21% range through Q4. The total rate dipped from 21% (October) to 19% (December) as we expanded into segments and geographies with lower baseline rates. Tier 1+2 company rates on desktop held at 26–28% — the dip reflects rollout breadth, not degradation. January's product launches should begin reversing this; we'll report results next month.

CLM's Q1 product work is organized around four customer-outcome pillars: *Right Level of Verification*, *Fast Approval Fast Start*, *Clear Expectations Upfront*, and *Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market*. January concentrated on verification efficiency and approval speed. Work under *Clear Expectations Upfront* is planned for later this quarter.

## Rollout Status

CLM now covers [X]% of direct-to-Payoneer (d2p) global traffic and [Y]% of all traffic, up from 21% and 13% in December — driven by UK's full rollout and Partners Phase 2 expanding CLM to 400+ additional programs.

## Key Achievements

### Right Level of Verification

**Real-time quality feedback** (KYC Service) — Launched a global A/B experiment: the system flags POR quality issues — blurriness, cropping, missing data — instantly during upload, replacing the days-long wait-then-reject cycle. Targeting 5% POR approval rate uplift; results expected mid-February.

**e-Collection for companies** (KYC Service + Localization) — Using a single input — company registration number — the system pre-fills company details from e-verification vendors. Live since late January for companies in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Turkey, Philippines, Argentina, and Pakistan. Customers provide one data point instead of four; when confirmed, CVD and POCA document requirements are removed. At full rollout across these 7 countries: 9% KYC funnel completion uplift and 8% approval rate uplift expected.

**US document requirements reduced** (Localization) — EIN requirement removed for eKYB-passing customers, live for 100% of US traffic (78% of US companies). POCA removal when e-verification succeeds: live at 50% rollout. Targeting 7-day reduction in approval time.

### Fast Approval, Fast Start

**POR address extraction** (KYC Service) — Full address extraction via Persona launched January 13. Early data: test group auto-approves ~1% more PORs than control. Two additional countries opened (Turkey and Ukraine at 25% of traffic). Next: expand to all global addresses.

**Documents orchestration: authenticity fallback** (KYC Service) — When Resistant.AI returns an indecisive fraud check, the system now routes to Persona automatically (launched January 28). Targets the current ~18% indecisive rate. In initial validation (5% of traffic), test group approves ~4% more documents. At scale (~45K documents monthly): 8% more documents approved, 2% KYC account approval uplift expected.

### Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market

**T1 Localization** (Localization & Licensing):
- **Brazil:** Approval rate 41% → 47%. Time to approval down 25–31%.
- **UK:** Approval rate 41% → 47%. Time to approval improved 26% (5.8 → 4.3 days).
- Both markets reduced ops document review volume by requiring fewer documents.

**Partners Phase 2** (Delegated Onboarding) — Rolled out January 19. Covers non-Lite Plan Tier 3, 30% of Tier 2, 10% of Tier 1, plus Banking and PWP programs. 400+ programs, ~15,000 registrations/month expected. ~1,000 registrations in the first two weeks — 5,000 (mid-February target) required for statistically significant conversion data.

## Workstream Updates

**T1 Localization** (Yael) — On track. US: monitoring EIN impact, scaling POCA toward 100%. Q1 eKYB expansion plan due mid-February. Singapore vendor evaluation: decision expected [date]. Next: full eCollection via local vendors in Brazil and UK.

**Vendor Optimization** (Elad) — POR extraction, authenticity fallback, and vendor A/B tests running. RAI indecisive rate trending down: 20% (mid-2025) → 17% (Dec) → targeting 14.5% (Feb). Sumsub pricing received, Applause selfie POC offered, Persona evaluation ongoing. Vendor monitoring dashboard launching mid-February.

**Partners Rollout** (Meital) — Phase 2 stable. Evaluating through mid-February before scaling to 100% Lite plan + phased eBay rollout.

**China & Hong Kong** (Yael) — China Drop 0 complete. Drop 1 now targets 2nd week of March (shifted from late February). Go/No-Go: February 24. Training and workflow prep due March 7. Hong Kong: Figma finalized, vendor integration underway, development targeting end of March.

**KYC New Flow** (Elad) — Real-time quality experiment live; results expected mid-February. Multiple concurrent A/B tests launched. Risk: overlapping experiments may confound individual result attribution.

## Challenges & Learnings

**China timeline** — Drop 1 shifted from late February to 2nd week of March. Root cause: training materials, guides, and workflows were underscoped in the original timeline. Go/No-Go: February 24.

**Concurrent experiment load** — Multiple concurrent vendor tests, rollouts, and A/B experiments risk confounding individual impact measurement. Mitigation: shared experiment tracker across workstreams, launching [date].

**Heads up:** The China Go/No-Go on February 24 will determine Q1 rollout timing. Decision and updated plan to follow by end of February.

## Looking Ahead — February

### Right Level of Verification

**IDV collection in account setup** (experiment) — Moving identity verification into account setup with real-time data extraction, replacing manual entry. Scope: all CLM users in incorporation countries. Expected: 2.5% KYC funnel completion uplift, 2% approval rate uplift.

**POR collection in account setup** (experiment) — Moving POR collection into account setup so users upload documents while already providing personal information, not as a separate step later. Scope: all CLM users globally. Expected: 1.5% KYC funnel completion uplift, 1% approval rate uplift.

**POR Localization** — Adding country-specific document types for Korea, Turkey, Ukraine, and UAE. Expected: 1% POR approval rate uplift in those countries.

**Companies' document removal** — Removing CVD and POCA requirements when e-verification confirms data, even without e-Collection. GA for companies, pending vendor coverage.

### Fast Approval, Fast Start

**Vendor scaling** — Completing POR full-address and authenticity fallback tests by mid-February. RAI indecisive rate on track to reach 14.5% — lowest ever. Next target: single digits by [quarter].

**Vendor monitoring** — Launching systematic performance analysis across all verification vendors: true positive/negative rates and match rates. Enables data-driven vendor selection and SLA enforcement.

### Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market

**Enterprise Partners** — After Phase 2 evaluation (mid-February), scaling to 100% Lite plan + phased eBay rollout. Opening CLM for Enterprise partners supporting payment methods beyond account-based.

**T1 Localization** — Brazil and UK: full eCollection rollout via local vendors. US: finalizing Q1 eKYB plan, continuing POCA scaling.

**China & Hong Kong** — China Go/No-Go February 24. Hong Kong development targeting end of March.
