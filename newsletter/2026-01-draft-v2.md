# CLM Newsletter – January 2026

Hi All,

January was about turning last year's platform investments into customer-facing results. The UK became our first country at 100% CLM rollout, we launched e-Collection across 7 countries, and we shipped real-time quality feedback for document uploads.

Corrections and additions welcome — reach out directly.

Yonatan.

## Status of CLM

The UK reached 100% CLM rollout in January with a 47% approval rate — the highest of any hub country and our first full-country deployment. This validates the localization-first approach: local e-verification vendors, country-specific document handling, and tailored flows produce measurably better outcomes.

Overall approval rates remained in the 19–21% range through Q4. The total rate dipped from 21% (October) to 19% (December), correlating with rollout expansion into segments and geographies with lower baseline performance. Tier 1+2 company rates on desktop held steady at 26–28%, indicating the core flow is performing — the dip reflects breadth of rollout, not degradation. We're tracking whether January's product launches reverse this trend.

This quarter, we're framing CLM's product work around four customer-outcome pillars — *Right Level of Verification*, *Fast Approval Fast Start*, *Clear Expectations Upfront*, and *Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market*. January was heaviest on verification efficiency and approval speed. The achievements below reflect this framing, with team attribution throughout. Workstream updates follow for operational continuity.

## Key Achievements

### Right Level of Verification

**Real-time quality feedback** (KYC Service) — Launched a global A/B experiment: the system now flags POR quality issues — blurriness, cropping, missing data — instantly during upload, replacing the days-long wait-then-reject cycle. Targeting 5% POR approval rate uplift; results expected mid-February.

**e-Collection for companies** (KYC Service + Localization) — Using a single input — company registration number — the system pre-fills company details from e-verification vendors. Live since late January for companies in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Turkey, Philippines, Argentina, and Pakistan. Customers provide one data point instead of four; when confirmed, CVD and POCA document requirements are removed. At full rollout across top-tier countries: 9% KYC funnel completion uplift and 8% approval rate uplift expected.

**US document requirements reduced** (Localization) — EIN requirement removed for eKYB-passing customers, live for 100% of US traffic (78% of US companies). POCA removal when e-verification succeeds at 50% rollout. Targeting up to 7 days reduction in approval time.

### Fast Approval, Fast Start

**POR address extraction** (KYC Service) — Full address extraction via Persona launched January 13. Early data: test group auto-approves ~1% more PORs than control. Two additional countries opened (Turkey and Ukraine at 25% population). Plan: expand to all global addresses.

**Documents orchestration: authenticity fallback** (KYC Service) — When Resistant.AI returns an indecisive fraud check, the system now routes to Persona automatically (launched January 28). Targets the current ~18% indecisive rate, aiming for 100% definitive decisions. In sanity mode (5% of traffic), test group approves ~4% more documents. At scale (~45K documents monthly): 8% more documents approved, 2% KYC account approval uplift expected.

### Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market

**T1 Localization** (Localization & Licensing):
- **Brazil:** Approval rate 41% → 47%. Time to approval down 25–31%.
- **UK:** 100% rollout reached. Approval rate 41% → 47%. Time to approval improved 26% (5.8 → 4.3 days).
- Both markets show reduced document review load for ops, driven by fewer required documents.

**Partners Phase 2** (Delegated Onboarding) — Rolled out January 19. Covers non-Lite Plan Tier 3, 30% of Tier 2, 10% of Tier 1, plus Banking and PWP programs. 400+ programs, ~15,000 registrations/month expected. ~1,000 registrations in the first weeks — we need ~5,000 (mid-February) for meaningful conversion data.

**China Phase 0** (Localization & Licensing) — Drop 0 release and pilot testing complete, bugs fixed. Development continuing toward Drop 1 (see Workstream Updates for timeline).

## Workstream Updates

**T1 Localization** (Yael) — On track. US: EIN removal live, POCA at 50%. Finalizing Q1 eKYB expansion plan. Singapore vendor evaluation ongoing. Next: full eCollection via local vendors in Brazil and UK.

**Vendor Optimization** (Elad) — Multiple tests running (POR extraction, authenticity fallback, vendor A/B). RAI indecisive rate trending down: 20% (mid-2025) → 17% (Dec) → targeting 14.5% (Feb). Multi-vendor POCs advancing (Sumsub, Applause, Persona selfie). Vendor monitoring dashboard launching February.

**Partners Rollout** (Meital) — Phase 2 stable. Evaluating through mid-February before scaling to 100% Lite plan + phased eBay rollout.

**China & Hong Kong** (Yael) — China Drop 1 shifted from late February. Go/No-Go February 24; revised target: 5% new registration traffic, 2nd week of March. Training and workflow prep targeting ~March 7. Hong Kong: Figma finalized, vendor integration in progress, development targeting end of March.

**KYC New Flow** (Elad) — Real-time quality experiment live. Multiple concurrent A/B tests launched. Team managing complexity from overlapping experiments and feature flags.

## Challenges & Learnings

**Approval rate trajectory** — Total rate dipped 21% → 19% (Oct–Dec) while Tier 1+2 company rates held (26–28%). The dip correlates with broadening rollout into lower-performing segments. We're tracking January product launches for reversal signals.

**China timeline** — Drop 1 shifted from late February to the 2nd week of March. Root cause: training materials, guides, and workflows require 3–4 additional weeks of preparation. Go/No-Go: February 24.

**Concurrent experiment load** — Multiple vendor tests, rollouts, and A/B experiments running simultaneously make it difficult to isolate individual impact. We're establishing a shared experiment tracker across workstreams to prevent overlap and improve result attribution.

**Heads up:** The China Go/No-Go on February 24 will determine Q1 rollout timing for our largest untapped market. We'll share the decision and updated plan afterward.

## Looking Ahead — February

### Right Level of Verification

**IDV collection in account setup** (experiment) — Moving identity verification into account setup with real-time data extraction, replacing manual entry. All CLM users in incorporation countries. Expected: 2.5% KYC funnel completion uplift, 2% approval rate uplift.

**POR collection in account setup** (experiment) — Moving POR collection into account setup for contextual collection. All CLM users globally. Expected: 1.5% KYC funnel completion uplift, 1% approval rate uplift.

**POR Localization** — Adding country-specific document types for Korea, Turkey, Ukraine, and UAE. Expected: 1% POR approval rate uplift in those countries.

**Companies' document removal** — Removing CVD and POCA requirements when e-verification confirms data, even without e-Collection. GA for companies, pending vendor coverage.

### Fast Approval, Fast Start

**Vendor scaling** — Completing POR full-address and authenticity fallback tests by mid-February. RAI indecisive rate on track to reach 14.5% — lowest ever — heading toward single-digit targets.

**Vendor monitoring** — Launching systematic performance analysis across all verification vendors: true positive/negative rates and match rates. Provides the data foundation for ongoing optimization.

### Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market

**Enterprise Partners** — Evaluating Phase 2 through mid-February, then scaling to 100% Lite plan + phased eBay rollout. Opening CLM for Enterprise partners supporting payment methods beyond account-based.

**T1 Localization** — Brazil and UK: full eCollection rollout via local vendors. US: finalizing Q1 eKYB plan, continuing POCA scaling.

**China & Hong Kong** — China Go/No-Go February 24. Hong Kong development targeting end of March.
