# CLM Newsletter – January 2026

Hi All,

As we kick off 2026, CLM is entering a pivotal phase. The infrastructure and rollout foundation built last year is now translating into product capabilities that directly improve the customer experience. Starting this quarter, we're organizing our work — and these updates — around the customer outcomes we're solving for. More on that below.

As always, if you feel I missed or misrepresented anything, please reach out.

Yonatan.

## Status of CLM

CLM approval rates remained in the 19–21% range through Q4, with Tier 1+2 company rates on desktop holding steady at 26–28%. [ACTION NEEDED: Add 1-2 sentences explaining the dip from 21% to 19% — mix shift from rollout expansion? Seasonal? New segments?]

The biggest milestone this month: the UK became our first country at 100% CLM rollout, reaching 47% approval rate — the highest of any hub country. This validates the localization-first approach and sets the playbook for additional countries.

In January, we shipped several capabilities aimed at reducing the document burden on customers — e-Collection across 7 countries, EIN document removal in the US, and real-time quality feedback during uploads. These are part of a broader strategic shift: rather than organizing our work by internal team, we're now framing CLM's product roadmap around four customer-outcome pillars — *Clear Expectations Upfront*, *Right Level of Verification*, *Fast Approval, Fast Start*, and *Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market*. You'll see these reflected in the structure below.

## Approval Rates

| Metric | September | October | November | December |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Approval Rate, total | 16% | 21% | 21% | 19% |
| Approval Rate, Tier 1+2, companies, desktop | 29% | 28% | 26% | 27% |

## Rollout Status

UK is now at 100% CLM rollout with a 47% approval rate. [ACTION NEEDED: Add overall d2p global traffic % and all-traffic % — these were 21% and 13% in December before UK went to 100%.] Partners Phase 2 expanded CLM coverage to 400+ additional partner programs.

## Key Achievements

### Clear Expectations Upfront

**Real-Time Quality Feedback** — We launched a global A/B experiment providing real-time quality feedback during Proof of Residence uploads. Instead of waiting days for a manual rejection, the system instantly flags issues — blurriness, cropping, missing information — the moment a customer uploads. This eliminates the "wait-and-fail" loop that drives customer frustration and resubmission cycles. We're projecting a 5% uplift in POR approval rates.

### Right Level of Verification

**e-Collection for companies** (launched late January) — Using a single input — company registration number — we now pre-fill company details including address from e-verification vendors. Targeting companies in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Turkey, Philippines, Argentina, and Pakistan. Customers provide one data point instead of four, and when confirmed, two document requirements (CVD and POCA) are removed entirely.
- *Why it matters:* At full rollout across all top-tier countries, we expect a 9% uplift in KYC funnel completion and 8% uplift in approval rates.

**US document requirement reductions** — Removed the EIN document requirement for customers who pass eKYB, now live for 100% of US traffic and covering 78% of US companies. Targeting up to 7 days reduction in approval time. Additionally, POCA document removal when e-verification succeeds is now at 50% rollout.

### Fast Approval, Fast Start

**Vendor POR improvements** — Full address extraction using Persona launched January 13. Early results: the test group auto-approves ~1% more PORs than the control group. Two additional countries opened for POR extraction (Turkey and Ukraine at 25% population).

**Documents orchestration: authenticity fallback** (launched January 28) — When Resistant.AI returns an indecisive result on document fraud checks, the system now automatically routes to Persona for a second opinion. This targets the current ~18% indecisive outcome rate, aiming for 100% definitive authenticity decisions. In sanity mode (5% of population), the test group approves ~4% more documents. At full scale (~45K documents monthly), we expect an 8% increase in documents approved and a 2% uplift in KYC accounts approved.

### Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market

**T1 Localization** — Brazil and UK continue showing strong results since their eKYB launches:
- **Brazil:** Approval rate up from 41% to 47%. Time from registration to approval decreased 25–31%.
- **UK:** Approval rate up from 41% to 46%, now at 47% with 100% rollout. Average time to approval improved 26% (5.8 to 4.3 days).
- **US:** EIN removal live. POCA removal at 50% rollout.
- All three markets show reduced document review load for reps, driven by fewer required documents.

**Partners Phase 2** (rolled out January 19) — Now covering all non-Lite Plan Tier 3 partners, 30% of Tier 2, and 10% of Tier 1, plus Banking partnership and PWP programs. This phase spans 400+ programs with an expected ~15,000 registrations per month. Early results: ~1,000 registrations so far — too early to draw conclusions on conversion, but we're monitoring closely.

**China Phase 0 complete** — Drop 0 release and pilot testing done, bugs fixed. Development continuing toward Drop 1 (see Looking Ahead).

## Challenges & Learnings

**Approval rate trajectory** — Total approval rates dipped from 21% to 19% between October and December, while Tier 1+2 company rates on desktop remained stable (26–28%). [ACTION NEEDED: Add the explanation — is this mix shift from broader rollout, new lower-performing segments, seasonal patterns?]

**China timeline adjustment** — China Drop 1 has shifted from the original late-February target. A Go/No-Go decision is scheduled for February 24, with the current target of 5% new registration traffic in the second week of March. We're prioritizing quality — guides, workflows, and training need 3–4 additional weeks.

**Concurrent rollout complexity** — With multiple experiments, vendor tests, and feature rollouts running simultaneously, isolating the impact of individual initiatives has become increasingly difficult. We're working on better cross-workstream coordination to manage this.

## Looking Ahead — February

### Clear Expectations Upfront

**IDV collection in account setup** (experiment) — Moving identity verification earlier in the flow, during account setup. Real-time data extraction and confirmation replaces manual entry, reducing touchpoints and filtering for high-intent users. Targeting all CLM users in incorporation countries. Expected: 2.5% KYC funnel completion uplift, 2% approval rate uplift.

**POR collection in account setup** (experiment) — Moving Proof of Residence collection into account setup, keeping requests in context while the customer is providing personal information. Targeting all CLM users globally. Expected: 1.5% KYC funnel completion uplift, 1% approval rate uplift.

### Right Level of Verification

**POR Localization** — Adding country-specific document types for Korea, Turkey, Ukraine, and UAE to give customers a broader range of accepted POR documents. Expected: 1% uplift in POR approval rates in those countries.

**Companies' document removal** — Expanding removal of CVD and POCA requirements whenever e-verification confirms the data, even when e-Collection is not available. GA for companies, pending vendor coverage.

### Fast Approval, Fast Start

**Vendor optimization scaling** — Completing the POR full-address and authenticity fallback tests (mid-February target). Resistant.AI indecisive rate trajectory: 20% (mid-2025) → 17% (December) → expected 14.5% (February), on the path to single-digit targets.

**Vendor monitoring launch** — Systematic performance analysis of all verification vendors, including true positive and true negative rates. This will provide the data foundation for ongoing vendor optimization decisions.

### Onboarding That Fits My Business & Market

**Enterprise Partners** — Evaluating Phase 2 results through mid-February before scaling further. Then: 100% Lite plan rollout + phased eBay rollout. Also opening CLM traffic for Enterprise partners supporting additional payment methods beyond account-based.

**T1 Localization** — Brazil and UK moving toward full eCollection rollout via local vendors. US: finalizing Q1 eKYB expansion plan and continuing POCA removal scaling. Singapore vendor evaluation continuing.

**China & Hong Kong** — China Drop 1 targeting completion, Go/No-Go February 24. Hong Kong: Figma design finalized, vendor integration in progress, development targeting end of March.
