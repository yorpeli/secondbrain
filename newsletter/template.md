# CLM Monthly Newsletter — Canonical Template

> This defines the standard structure for the monthly CLM newsletter.
> Use as a skeleton when drafting. Not every section needs equal length — let the month's story dictate emphasis.

---

## 1. Opening

Personal note from Yonatan. 2-3 sentences max. Can include:
- A thank-you or callout (people, teams, cross-functional partners)
- A one-line theme for the month
- Standing invitation to reach out with questions or corrections

Sign off with "Yonatan."

---

## 2. Status of CLM

2-3 paragraphs covering the big picture. This is the "if you read nothing else" section.

**Must include:**
- Approval rate trajectory (direction + headline number)
- Rollout status (% of d2p traffic, % of all traffic)
- Strategic focus for the period — what CLM is optimizing for right now

**Tone:** Strategic, not operational. A VP outside CLM should understand the state of play after reading this.

## 3. Approval Rates

Rolling table showing the last 4 months. Always include:

| Metric | Month-3 | Month-2 | Month-1 | Current |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Approval Rate, total | | | | |
| Approval Rate, Tier 1+2, companies, desktop | | | | |

**Notes:**
- Flag any months with insufficient data (e.g., low rollout %) with asterisks + footnote
- If a metric definition changed, note it

---

## 4. Rollout Status

One-liner. Format: "We are now rolled out to X% of d2p global traffic and Y% of all traffic."

If there were new country rollouts this month, name them. If no change, say so explicitly ("No new rollout expansions this month").

## 5. Key Achievements

Organized by swimlane/workstream. Each achievement follows this pattern:

**[Swimlane Name]**
- **What happened:** Specific, measurable outcome. Lead with the result, not the effort.
- **Why it matters:** Business impact — revenue, conversion, operational cost, customer experience, compliance posture. Quantify when possible.

**Guidelines:**
- 3-6 achievements per month (quality over quantity)
- Every achievement must have a "why it matters" — no exceptions
- Failures and unsuccessful experiments go in Section 6, not here
- Keep depth roughly even across items — don't let one swimlane dominate 60% of the section

---

## 6. Challenges & Learnings

Experiments that didn't work, blockers encountered, areas where results fell short. Frame honestly but constructively:
- What was attempted
- What the data showed
- What we're doing about it (next steps, deep-dive, pivot)

**Why this section exists:** It builds credibility. A newsletter that only reports wins is less trusted than one that also shows honest assessment. It also ensures setbacks don't get buried inside "achievements."

*If there are no notable challenges in a given month, this section can be omitted — but that should be rare.*

---

## 7. Looking Ahead

New priorities, upcoming launches, planned experiments. Forward-looking items that weren't mentioned in previous newsletters.

- Each item gets 2-3 sentences of context
- Include expected timelines where known
- Name owners or teams where relevant

---

## 8. Open Items Tracker

Items carried forward from previous months. This section ensures continuity — nothing silently disappears.

Format:

| Item | First Mentioned | Status Update |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| [Item name] | [Month] | [What changed since last mention, or "No update — still in progress"] |

**Rules:**
- Every item mentioned in "Looking Ahead" in a previous newsletter must appear here until explicitly closed
- "Closed" means: shipped, deprioritized (say so), or absorbed into another initiative (name it)
- If an item has had "no update" for 2+ months, flag it for review — either provide a real update or close it with a reason
